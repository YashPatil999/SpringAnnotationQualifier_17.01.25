Qualifier Annotation in Java

In Java, the @Qualifier annotation is part of the Java Dependency Injection (DI) framework and is used to resolve ambiguity when there are multiple beans of the same type. By default, the DI container will inject any available bean that matches the required type. However, if there are multiple beans of the same type, @Qualifier helps to specify which one to inject.

It is commonly used in Spring Framework, which provides powerful DI capabilities, allowing developers to manage the relationships between various beans and components.

Purpose of @Qualifier:

The @Qualifier annotation is used alongside the @Autowired annotation to distinguish between different beans that implement the same interface or have the same type. This ensures that the correct bean is injected into the dependent class.
